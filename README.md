**A sample JAVA Spring boot wrapper to cover w3w basic APIs**

This is a Spring boot application that can be run by using `mvn spring-boot:run` in the root where pom.xml exists; considering you have all the dependencies installed (Maven, Java)

Please note - Put your *API key* in the place of *DUMMY_API_KEY* without quotes in `src/main/resources/application.properties`
